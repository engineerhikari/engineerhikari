## 💌 About Me
Hi! I'm **Ririn**, a passionate student in tech & design who loves learning new things (especially when it's pink 💗).  
Currently exploring web development, UI/UX, and cute VSCode themes ☁️🎀

## 💻 Tools I Use
- ✨ **VSCode** with soft pink themes
- 🌐 **HTML, CSS, JS** with love
- 🌀 **TailwindCSS** for magical layouts
- 📝 Learning TypeScript slowly but surely

---

## 🐣 Currently Learning
- React & component styling  
- Mobile design on Figma  
- Git + GitHub (PR-ready, hehe 😆)

---

## 🧋 Aesthetic Goals
- Build my first portfolio site 🌸  
- Contribute to open source  
- Make a dashboard app with soft UI  
- Stay cute while debugging (it's hard 😭)

---
